This repository is for mantisbt sites packaged and organized for direct
use with openshift.  This means that among other things the web application
paths will match up to how openshift expects them.  You should be able to
create a local git repository for yourself that uses both this and your
actual openshift application repository as remote sources, and then migrate
future updates posted into this repository simply by merging from this remote
source and then pushing back to your openshift application repo.
